=head1 NAME

Data::Libra - Generating unique and random values from a string.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Data::Libra;

    # using default Libra
    my $libra = new Data::Libra();

    # scan your string
    my $values = $libra->scan('a string');
    print "VALUE: $values->{VALUE}\n"; # a random value from 0 to 100

I<or>

    use Data::Libra;

    # create your Libra!
    my $love_fortune = new Data::Libra(
        salt   => 'necessary to cook well:-p',
        values => {COMPATIBILITY => [0, 100]},
    );

    # calculate your love compatibility number.
    my $result = $love_fortune->scan('Your Name' . 'GirlFriend\'s Name');
    print "$result->{COMPATIBILITY}%\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Data::Libra generate random values from a string. If you scan the same strings, you will get the same values. It works like "Barcode Battler" or "Monster Rancher(Monster Farm)".

=head2 Methods

=over

=item my $libra = new Data::Libra( ... );

Constructor of Data::Libra. All parameters have default values.

=over 2

=item salt => $salt (DEFAULT: `hostname`)

set $salt that is used by random values generator. If a different salt is used, different values will be generated. 

=item values => {KEY => [$min, $max], ...} (DEFAULT: {VALUE => [0, 100]}

set items that you want to get from scan() method. KEY will be contained in the result of scan(). The generated integer corresponding to KEY becomes within the range from $min to $max. 

=back

=item my $ref_values = $libra->scan($some_strings);

generate random values from $some_strings.

For example, if you set values param like this:

  my $libra = new Data::Libra(
      values => {KEY1 => [100, 1000], KEY2 => [1, 100]}
  );

The returned value is a hash reference like this:

  {
    KEY1 => 688,
    KEY2 => 36,
  }

=back

"Libra" is a name of the magic in Final Fantasy by which scan status of monsters.
